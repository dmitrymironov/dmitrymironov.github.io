For C++ 17 version of KLFM algorithm implementation, see <a href="https://github.com/dmitrymironov/klfm18" target="_blank">github</a>
<p>
KLFM stands for Kernighan-Lin Fiduccia-Mattheyses, and it's in fact most popular C++ graph by-partitioning algoritm<p>
It was first introduced in 1982, original paper  "A Linear-Time Heuristic for Improving Network Partitions" <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mazum/fmcut1.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a><p>
One of the best known implementations is provided as part as MLPART package, developed by <a href="https://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/~abk/" target="_blank">prof. Andrew Kahng</a> research group in 1999 <a href="http://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Publications/Conferences/c104.pdf">[2]</a><p>
Less complex and simple implementation was developed and published in 2015 on SourceForge <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/klfm/code/ci/master/tree/" target="_blank">Source code</a><p>
